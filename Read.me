This repository contains directories that demonstrate the use of different data structures. 
Most of these projects come from homework or test questions, and therefore is not all mine. 
Some of the code was given to me as a starter, mainly for the questions used on tests. 
For these projects, I still wrote most of the progam on my own, as the starter code was usually method headers or instructions.
